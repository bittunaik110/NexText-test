I need to completely redesign the NexText app UI to match Facebook Messenger design exactly. Current app has purple gradient theme, but I need the clean, modern Facebook Messenger look.

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS (Facebook Messenger UI):

1. COLOR SCHEME:
   - Remove ALL purple gradients
   - Use Facebook Messenger blue (#0084FF) for primary actions
   - White/light gray background (#FFFFFF, #F0F2F5)
   - Clean, minimal design like the reference images

2. CHAT LIST SCREEN:
   - Add Stories/Status row at top with horizontal scroll
   - Circular avatars with + button for "Your story"
   - Green dot indicator for online users (small, positioned on avatar)
   - Clean white background
   - Better spacing between chat items
   - Show profile pictures for all chats
   - Message preview text in gray
   - Timestamp on the right side
   - Read/unread status indicator (blue dot for unread)

3. CHAT WINDOW:
   - Header: Clean white background with user name
   - User avatar on left of header
   - Blue voice/video call buttons on right
   - Message bubbles: Blue (#0084FF) for sent, Light gray (#E4E6EB) for received
   - Rounded corners on bubbles (more rounded than current)
   - Better message spacing
   - Profile picture next to received messages
   - Message status icons below sent messages (not inside)
   - Smooth animations

4. MESSAGE INPUT:
   - Clean white background
   - Rounded input field with light gray border
   - Blue send button (Messenger blue)
   - Icon buttons: Camera, Image, Mic, Emoji, Like button
   - Modern icon design

5. BOTTOM NAVIGATION:
   - Clean white background
   - Icon + label format
   - Messenger blue for active tab
   - Gray for inactive tabs
   - Tabs: Chats, People/Contacts, Stories/Status (with notification badge if needed)

6. TYPOGRAPHY:
   - Use system fonts (SF Pro on iOS, Roboto on Android feel)
   - Clean, readable text
   - Proper font weights (semibold for names, regular for messages)

7. KEEP ALL FEATURES:
   - All WhatsApp-like chat functionality
   - Message status ticks (pending → sent → delivered → read)
   - Online/offline presence
   - Typing indicators
   - Unread badges
   - No auto-opening chats

REMOVE:
   - All purple gradients and colors
   - Dark theme (use light theme like Messenger)
   - Current styling that doesn't match Messenger

Please redesign the ENTIRE UI to look exactly like Facebook Messenger while keeping all chat features working. Make it look professional and polished like the real Messenger app.
