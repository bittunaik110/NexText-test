EXCELLENT WORK! Foundation is solid. Now complete the remaining pieces:

1. CHATWINDOW INTEGRATION - Import and add CallButton to chat header next to contact name

2. UPDATE CALLS PAGE - Query Firebase calls collection instead of mock data. Display real calls with: Avatar, Contact Name, Call Type (incoming/outgoing/missed), Timestamp (1 hour ago format), Duration, and PLAY button if recording exists

3. IMPLEMENT WEBRTC PEER CONNECTION - Use peerjs:
   - When call initiates, create PeerJS peer connection
   - Get microphone stream with getUserMedia()
   - Establish peer connection between 2 browser tabs
   - Stream audio between peers
   - Handle connection errors gracefully

4. SOCKET.IO INTEGRATION - Add real-time call signaling:
   - When call initiates, emit 'callInitiated' via Socket.IO to recipient
   - Recipient gets call notification with answer/decline
   - Pass call offer/answer through Socket.IO for WebRTC setup
   - Emit 'callEnded' when call disconnects

5. CALL RECORDING - Add MediaRecorder API:
   - Start recording when call connects
   - Save recording to Firebase Storage as .webm file
   - Update call history with recording URL

6. DATABASE UPDATE - After recording saved, update Firebase calls collection with recording URL

7. PLAY BUTTON - If call has recording URL in Calls page, show play button that opens AudioPlayer component

8. TEST COMPREHENSIVE:
   - Open 2 browser tabs with same app
   - Login as different users in each tab
   - Initiate call from tab 1, verify notification in tab 2
   - Answer call, verify WebRTC connection works
   - Speak and verify audio streams
   - End call, verify duration saved
   - Go to Calls tab, verify new call in history with recording
   - Click play button, verify recording plays
   - Verify all data saved in Firebase

9. CREATE README - After testing complete, create VOICE_CALL_FEATURE.md in FEATURES_DEATILS_ReadMe folder with:
   - Feature overview
   - WebRTC implementation details
   - How to use (initiate, answer, end calls)
   - Call recording and playback
   - Firebase schema (calls collection)
   - Testing instructions
   - Known limitations

TEST THOROUGHLY AND DOUBLE TEST! This is critical functionality.
