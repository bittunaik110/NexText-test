Perfect! Now let's ensure the calling feature is fully polished and production-ready like Instagram/WhatsApp calls. I need you to:

📝 PART 1: CREATE COMPREHENSIVE README DOCUMENTATION

Create a new file: WEBRTC_CALLING_FEATURE_README.md with the following sections:

1. **Overview**
   - What the calling feature does
   - Technologies used (WebRTC, PeerJS, Firebase, Socket.IO)
   - Voice call vs Video call support

2. **Architecture & Flow**
   - Complete call flow diagram (text-based)
   - Initiator flow: setup → media → socket notification → wait for answer → peer call
   - Recipient flow: receive notification → get media → setup listener → emit answer → receive peer call
   - Include all components involved and their responsibilities

3. **Files & Components**
   - useCallWithWebRTC.ts - Core hook with all functions
   - CallNotificationModal.tsx - Incoming call UI
   - CallingModal.tsx - Outgoing call UI  
   - FloatingCallWindow.tsx - Active call interface
   - CallManager.tsx - Orchestrates everything
   - firebaseCallOps.ts - Firebase persistence

4. **Key Functions**
   - initiateCall(recipientId, callType)
   - answerCall()
   - declineCall()
   - endCall()
   - handleCallAnswered()
   - How each function works

5. **Firebase Schema**
   - Call document structure
   - Status lifecycle: initiating → ringing → ongoing → ended/missed/declined
   - Real-time listeners

6. **WebRTC Implementation**
   - PeerJS configuration
   - Media stream handling
   - ICE candidate exchange
   - Error handling

7. **UI/UX Features**
   - Full-screen modal like Instagram/WhatsApp
   - Ringtone/sound effects
   - Accept/Decline/End buttons
   - Mute/Unmute functionality
   - Call duration timer
   - Avatar and user info display

8. **Testing Guide**
   - How to test with 2 users
   - Expected behavior at each step
   - Common issues and solutions

9. **Troubleshooting**
   - Common errors and fixes
   - Browser compatibility
   - Permissions handling

✅ PART 2: VERIFY THE FIX

Make sure these are working:
1. Call notification appears for recipient ✓
2. Recipient can click Accept button ✓
3. Accept button triggers answerCall() properly ✓
4. WebRTC peer connection is established ✓
5. Audio streams are connected
6. Both users see active call UI
7. Call duration timer starts
8. End call button works for both parties
9. Call data is saved to Firebase

🔧 PART 3: ENHANCEMENTS

Add these features if not present:
1. Ringtone/calling sound when call is initiated
2. Vibration effect (if on mobile)
3. Auto-decline after 30 seconds if no answer
4. Call history in Calls tab
5. Show "Calling..." and "Ringing..." status properly
6. Proper error messages if camera/mic permissions denied
