NOTIFICATION BADGE - COMPREHENSIVE TESTING REQUIRED!

The badge feature has been implemented. Now I need MULTIPLE TEST CASES to verify it works correctly:

TEST CASE 1 - New Messages Add to Badge Count:
1. Open two browser tabs with different users
2. User A sends 3 messages to User B
3. User B should see badge showing "3" on contact
4. Verify badge appears in RED on chat list item
5. Screenshot the badge count

TEST CASE 2 - Badge Clears When Chat Opened:
1. User B opens chat with User A
2. Badge should DISAPPEAR when chat is opened
3. Verify unread count resets to 0
4. Verify mark-as-read logic works
5. Screenshot showing no badge after opening

TEST CASE 3 - Badge Re-appears with New Messages:
1. User B closes chat (goes back to chat list)
2. User A sends MORE messages
3. Badge should RE-APPEAR with new count
4. Verify count increments correctly
5. Screenshot showing badge count again

TEST CASE 4 - Badge Over 99 Shows "99+":
1. Simulate 100+ unread messages
2. Badge should show "99+" NOT "100"
3. Verify dynamic content displays correctly
4. Screenshot showing "99+"

TEST CASE 5 - Multiple Chats Have Different Badge Counts:
1. User C sends 5 messages to User B
2. User A still has 3 unread from earlier
3. Show 2 different contacts with 2 different badge counts
4. Verify each chat shows correct number
5. Screenshot showing multiple badges with different counts

TEST CASE 6 - Badge Persists After App Refresh:
1. User B has 7 unread messages
2. REFRESH the browser/app
3. Badge should STILL SHOW "7"
4. Verify Firebase persistence works
5. Screenshot showing badge after refresh

TEST CASE 7 - Total Badge on Chats Tab:
1. Multiple chats with unread messages (3 + 5 + 2 = 10 total)
2. "Chats" tab should show TOTAL badge "10"
3. Verify sum of all unread counts
4. Screenshot showing total badge on Chats tab

TEST CASE 8 - Badge Styling:
1. Verify RED background color (hover:bg-red-600)
2. Verify WHITE text color
3. Verify proper PADDING/SIZE
4. Verify SHADOW effect
5. Take screenshot showing styling

PLEASE:
1. Run ALL 8 test cases
2. Take SCREENSHOTS for each test
3. Verify badge count accuracy
4. Verify styling matches WhatsApp
5. Double-check Firebase persistence
6. Test on 2+ browser tabs
7. Document all test results

Build and test NOW - need complete verification!
