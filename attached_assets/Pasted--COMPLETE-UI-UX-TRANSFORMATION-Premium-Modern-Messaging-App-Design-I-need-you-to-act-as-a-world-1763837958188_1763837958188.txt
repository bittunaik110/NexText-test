🎨 COMPLETE UI/UX TRANSFORMATION - Premium Modern Messaging App Design

I need you to act as a world-class UI/UX designer and completely transform this chat application into a stunning, futuristic, mobile-first messaging experience that competes with WhatsApp, Telegram, and iMessage.

🎯 DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
The app must feel like a NATIVE MOBILE APP - users should forget they're using a web app. It should evoke feelings of:
- Premium quality and sophistication
- Smooth, delightful interactions
- Modern, clean aesthetics
- Trustworthy and professional
- Joyful to use daily

- Accent: Neon cyan for online status (#06b6d4)
