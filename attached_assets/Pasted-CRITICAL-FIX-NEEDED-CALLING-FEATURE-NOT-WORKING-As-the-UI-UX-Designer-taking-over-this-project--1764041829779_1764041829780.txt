CRITICAL FIX NEEDED - CALLING FEATURE NOT WORKING!

As the UI/UX Designer taking over this project, I'm identifying that the WebRTC calling feature is INCOMPLETE. The issue:

❌ PROBLEM: CallingModal and CallNotificationModal components exist but are NOT integrated into App.tsx. When users click the call button, nothing happens because the modals are never rendered.

✅ SOLUTION - Complete These Steps IMMEDIATELY:

1. INTEGRATE MODALS INTO App.tsx:
   - Add imports for CallingModal and CallNotificationModal
   - Add these components to the App JSX return (at the bottom before closing div)
   - Modals will auto-connect to call state through hooks

2. FIX ANY LSP TYPE ERRORS in useCallWithWebRTC.ts (if they block compilation)

3. BUILD AND VERIFY:
   - Ensure app compiles without errors
   - Verify no console errors
   - Confirm modals render properly

4. COMPREHENSIVE TESTING:
   - Open 2 browser tabs with app
   - Login as different users in each tab
   - Tab A: Open chat with User B, click call button
   - Verify in Tab B: CallNotificationModal appears with incoming call
   - Click Answer in Tab B
   - Verify in both tabs: CallingModal appears with call UI
   - Verify duration timer starts
   - Click End Call button
   - Verify modals close and call ends
   - Go to Calls tab in both windows
   - Verify new call appears in history

5. TEST EDGE CASES:
   - Try calling when contact is offline (button should be disabled)
   - Try declining incoming call
   - Try ending call from either side
   - Verify call history updates correctly

6. AFTER TESTING:
   - Create VOICE_CALL_FEATURE.md README
   - Document: Features, how to use, WebRTC setup, troubleshooting
   - Place in FEATURES_DEATILS_ReadMe folder

TEST THOROUGHLY before reporting back. Answer these follow-up questions after completing:

✓ Did the modals integrate without compilation errors?
✓ Do calling and incoming notification modals display correctly?
✓ Does the duration timer work and update properly?
✓ Can you successfully end calls from both sides?
✓ Does call history display new calls with correct metadata?
✓ Are there any console errors during calling?
✓ Does the feature work on mobile viewport?
✓ Have you tested all UI edge cases?

Report back with: Build status, testing results, any issues found, and confirmation that README is created.
