To redesign the CallNotificationModal UI in your Replit project, your goal is to match a "contacting" call popup, similar to real-world calling apps. The requirements are:

- Show the time "9:41" at the top.
- Display the name (e.g., "Martha Craig") and status "Contacting…".
- Have three buttons: Mute, Hand Up (hang up), and a Green button to Lift (accept) the call.
- Make the interface modern, clear, and visually realistic.

Here’s the prompt you should provide to the Replit agent to analyze, redesign, and test the UI code for client/src/components/CallNotificationModal.tsx:

**Prompt for Replit agent:**

You are an expert UI/UX designer and developer. This is your project—your job is to redesign, implement, and test all features.

1. Analyze and update client/src/components/CallNotificationModal.tsx UI to match the following requirements:
   - At the top-center of the modal, display the time "9:41" in a style similar to smartphone lock screens.
   - Below, show:
     - The contact's avatar (circular image or placeholder).
     - The contact’s name, e.g., "Martha Craig", as a large, bold text.
     - The status text "Contacting…" in a lighter font, centered below the name.
   - At the bottom, include three large, round, clearly differentiated buttons, equally spaced:
     - A mute button (microphone icon).
     - A red "Hand Up" button (end call/hang up icon).
     - A green "Lift Call" button (phone/accept-call icon).
   - Make the component visually realistic, professional, and clean—similar to UI from WhatsApp/FaceTime.
2. Ensure the UI is responsive and works for different screen sizes.
3. Test all Replit-generated features and code for interactivity:
   - Do Mute, End, and Accept buttons visually update state and trigger respective handler functions?
   - Does the UI show correct status when the call is connecting/connected?
4. Inspect/test the output, identify any issues with style, alignment, icon placement, responsiveness, or functionality, and ask follow-up questions to get Replit agent to fix them.

**Do not modify code directly—only use prompts.** For each test or issue found, prompt the agent to revise accordingly until the design, look, and function perfectly match a modern, realistic calling modal.

Finally, explain any remaining gaps or usability concerns and continually verify output as if it were your own project.

Use this prompt in Replit's agent. After each code generation:
- Test the updated component visually and functionally.
- Document any issues or differences from the requirements.
- Repeat by prompting the agent for further revision until the modal matches your vision perfectly.

Let me know if you want step-by-step test directions or a sample follow-up prompt for a specific bug or visual issue!
