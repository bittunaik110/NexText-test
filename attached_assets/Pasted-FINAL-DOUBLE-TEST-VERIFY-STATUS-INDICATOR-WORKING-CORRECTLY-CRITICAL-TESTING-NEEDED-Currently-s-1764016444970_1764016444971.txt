FINAL DOUBLE TEST - VERIFY STATUS INDICATOR WORKING CORRECTLY:

CRITICAL TESTING NEEDED:
Currently showing 🟡 offline on header, but we need to verify:

1. IMMEDIATE TEST:
   a) Check Firebase database - is current USER's isOnline field set to TRUE?
   b) Does ChatWindow component correctly READ the contact's isOnline from DB?
   c) Does header indicator UPDATE IN REAL-TIME when status changes?
   d) Is the green 🟢 dot with pulse animation showing when isOnline=true?
   e) Is the yellow 🟡 dot static (no animation) showing when isOnline=false?

2. TEST DIFFERENT SCENARIOS:
   a) Check user's own status in Firebase (should be true since app is open)
   b) Manually toggle isOnline in Firebase console and watch header update
   c) Does status change in real-time? (within 2-3 seconds)
   d) Test with multiple chats - does each show correct status?

3. VERIFY LISTENER SETUP:
   a) Is ChatWindow using .onSnapshot() listener for contact's data?
   b) Does listener trigger when contact's isOnline changes in DB?
   c) Component state updates correctly?
   d) UI re-renders with new status indicator?

4. CHECK FOR BUGS:
   a) Status indicator shows but not updating - WHY?
   b) Is listener connected properly?
   c) Are there console errors about listeners?
   d) Is real-time sync working or is it delayed?

5. FIX IF NEEDED:
   - If not updating: ensure ChatWindow has active listener
   - If colors wrong: verify CSS colors are correct
   - If animation missing: verify pulse keyframes are applied

AFTER TESTING, ANSWER THESE FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:
   Q1: Is current user's status showing correctly as ONLINE in their own header?
   Q2: When contact status changes in DB, does UI update within 3 seconds?
   Q3: Are pulse animations working on green dot for ONLINE users?
   Q4: Is yellow dot STATIC (no animation) for OFFLINE users?
   Q5: Does header indicator work consistently across different chats?
   Q6: Are there any console errors or warnings?
   Q7: Do we need to add manual status toggle for testing?
