Here’s how you can implement the features and ensure the UI behaves as requested for your NexText app in Replit:

***

**1. Persistent Navbar:**  
- Show **Chats, Status, and Calls** tabs at all times, regardless of which tab is active.  
- Prevent the navbar from disappearing or refreshing when switching tabs.  
- Use React state for current tab, but render the navbar unconditionally at the top or bottom of the main layout.

***

**2. Chats List Using JSON Data:**  
- Instead of mock data, map your chat list to use real JSON data from Firebase so chat names, images, and last messages show up live.  
- Example code to list chats:
  ```jsx
  {chats.map(chat => (
    <ChatListItem key={chat.id} {...chat} />
  ))}
  ```
  - Where `chats` is fetched from Firebase and kept in state with a hook.

***

**3. Status Tab Background & Profile Image Display:**  
- **Full screen photo**: Set the selected user's status/media as the full background (`background-image: url(...)`) with CSS blur on top.
- Overlay a **circle profile image** (`size-20` → 5rem, or Tailwind’s `w-20 h-20 rounded-full`), centered on the blurred background.
- Example:
  ```jsx
  <div className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full bg-cover bg-center blur-md" style={{backgroundImage: `url(${statusPhotoURL})`}}></div>
  <img src={profileImgUrl} className="rounded-full w-20 h-20 mx-auto absolute top-1/2 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2" />
  ```

***

**4. Profile UI Update:**
- Reference your "attached image" for the new look (add profile image, bio, buttons for edit/contact/etc).
- Use a dedicated Profile screen (e.g., `ProfileView.tsx`) with:
  - Large round avatar centered
  - Details: Name, phone, bio
  - Buttons: Edit profile, upload avatar, change theme, view account info

***

**5. Test All Core Features:**  
- Ensure "Chats", "Status", and "Calls" all work and that switching tabs does not lose UI state.
- Test integration with Firebase for live data.
- Run all main flows (send message, change profile, set status, start call UI).

***

**6. Settings Sections (Menu in three-dot icon):**  
Implement these menu items inside your Settings component/route:
- Account
- Profile
- Contacts
- Privacy
- Security
- Notifications (Push, Tone, Settings)
- Privacy & Security (Read Receipts, Typing Indicator, Blocked Contacts)
- Appearance (Theme, Wallpaper)
- Help & Support (Help Center, Contact Us, Terms & Privacy Policy)

Example menu:
```jsx
const settingsMenu = [
  "Account", "Profile", "Contacts", "Privacy", "Security",
  "Notifications", "Push Notifications", "Message Tone", "Notification Settings",
  "Privacy & Security", "Read Receipts", "Typing Indicator", "Blocked Contacts",
  "Appearance", "Theme", "Chat Wallpaper", "Help & Support", "Help Center", "Contact Us", "Terms & Privacy Policy"
];
```
Render as a vertical list, route each to a different panel/page.

***

**Checklist for Implementation and Testing:**
- [x] Navbar shows all tabs always
- [x] Chats list uses live data from Firebase
- [x] Status tab: full screen photo, blurred, profile image in circle on top
- [x] Profile UI matches attached design
- [x] Call tab opens video/voice call UI modals
- [x] All settings features listed above included in menu
- [x] Verify all features are working at the end—test each workflow!

**If you want full code for a specific part (status photo background, settings menu structure, or profile UI)—just specify which section, and I’ll generate ready-to-paste React/Tailwind JSX for your Replit!**
