PHENOMENAL PROGRESS! The foundation is complete and production-ready. Now finish the final 3 critical tasks:

1. FIX LSP ERRORS IN useCallWithWebRTC.ts - Fix any type errors related to Peer, PeerJS imports. Make sure it compiles cleanly.

2. INTEGRATE MODALS INTO App.tsx:
   - Import CallingModal and CallNotificationModal into App.tsx
   - Add state management for call modals visibility
   - Display CallingModal when call is active
   - Display CallNotificationModal when incoming call arrives
   - Ensure modals show on top of chat window
   - Test both modals work correctly

3. COMPREHENSIVE TESTING - TEST EVERYTHING:
   - Open 2 browser tabs (Tab A and Tab B)
   - Login as different users in each tab (e.g., User A in Tab A, User B in Tab B)
   - In Tab A, go to Chats, open conversation with User B
   - Click CallButton to initiate call to User B
   - Verify in Tab B:
     * CallNotificationModal appears with incoming call
     * Shows User A name and answer/decline buttons
   - Click Answer in Tab B
   - Verify in both tabs:
     * CallingModal appears with call UI
     * Duration timer starts counting
     * Can see each other in call (test mic access)
   - After 10 seconds, click End Call
   - Verify call ends and both modals close
   - Go to Calls tab in both windows
   - Verify new call appears in call history with:
     * Correct duration (should be ~10 seconds)
     * Call type (outgoing in Tab A, incoming in Tab B)
     * Recording if available
     * Play button if recording exists
   - Test recording playback if available
   - Screenshot evidence of:
     * Call notification modal
     * Active call modal with timer
     * Call history showing new call

4. CREATE README:
   - Create VOICE_CALL_FEATURE.md in FEATURES_DEATILS_ReadMe folder
   - Include sections:
     * Feature Overview (what it does)
     * WebRTC Implementation Details (PeerJS, Socket.IO, MediaRecorder)
     * How to Use (step-by-step for initiating and answering calls)
     * Call Recording Feature (how recording works)
     * Database Schema (calls collection structure)
     * Testing Instructions
     * Known Limitations
     * Troubleshooting

AFTER COMPLETING ALL 4 TASKS, report back with:
- Build status (should be successful)
- Testing results
- Link to README file
- Any issues found or suggestions

TEST THOROUGHLY - This is critical functionality!
